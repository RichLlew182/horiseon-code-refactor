 <p>This was the first homework challenge for the EDX Bootcamp in Front End Development.</p> 

   <p>Our task was to take some existing html and css for a landing page for Horiseon Social Solution Services and to refactor that code to make the HTML use semantic elements instead of divs. We also had to improve the css by consolidating it where possible, and making sure both files followed a logical structure.
</p> 
  <p>We were also tasked with making the page more accessible overall, by adding alt text for all applicable images, and updating the window title.</p> 

  <p>Lastly we had to ensure that all heading elements fell in sequential order.</p>
